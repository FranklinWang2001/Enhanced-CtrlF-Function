Hello there beautiful people. This is some sample text so that I don't fail my CS class.
This is the first paragraph. I hope you enjoyed my incredible writing skills. I should get published. (Franklin's paragraph)

This is the second paragraph. I am writing this on behalf of Franklin, for he is the most beautiful
human being in the world. So beautiful that, I, Eric Zhou, cannot believe how beautiful he is. My goodness.

This third paragraph will be all about the beauty of Franklin. It is said that he can walk down the street, 
and both women and men will faint at the sight of such beauty. This is both a blessing and a curse to Franklin's life,
but he has had to learn to live with the beauty.

This final paragraph will be about the knowledge of Franklin. It is said that he knows all there is to know about everyting.
There is no element of CS he does not know, unless he wishes not to know it. There is no man on Earth smarter than Franklin.
At the end of it all, Franklin will not be suprised because he knew how it all would end.
